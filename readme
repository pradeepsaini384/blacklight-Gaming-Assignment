I have made this assignment in which i have 10000 data rows of user as per given attributes.and this project made in flask. 

also i have attached the databse sql file in the repository.

The following apis and urls:
1. Get current Week leaderboard :  https://pradeepsaini.info/blacklight/current_week_leaderboard 

its return top 200 rows according to the score 

2. Last Week leaderboard with country code :
https://pradeepsaini.info/blacklight/last_week_leaderboard/us

due to less data i have used in only five country data IN,US,AU,UK,NZ
so try with these country code 

its return top 200 rows of last Week leaderboard according to country code

3. return the rank of user using user id:
https://pradeepsaini.info/blacklight/user_rank/8



also to run this you have to install python and these dependencies using these command 
pip install flask 
pip install mysqlclient 
pip install mysqldb 

and then run using python app.py
